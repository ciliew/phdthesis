%Astrid's comment (currently in preface)
%
%This is my thesis. It is probably too long, unnecessarily hard to read, and doesn't really relate to the real world. It is about symmetries, topology, uncertainties and geometries and making things harder than they need to be. But it was fun to write and I tried making it fun to read as well. Judge by yourself if you have nothing better to spend your time on.
