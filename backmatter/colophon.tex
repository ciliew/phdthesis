%This document was typeset using the custom \LaTeXe\ document class  \texttt{ciliethesis} which is almost identical to \texttt{jespersthesis} by Jesper Rask Pedersen which is almost identical to \texttt{dionsthesis} by Dion Haefner, based on \texttt{uiothesis} developed by Eivind Uggedal. It uses Minion Pro, developed at Adobe Systems, and Fira Sans, developed by the Mozilla Foundation, as body fonts.
%\texttt{dionsthesis} is available at:

%The style of \texttt{uiothesis} was inspired by Robert Bringhurst's seminal book on typography \work{The Elements of Typographic Style}. Typographic, structural and graphical decisions in this document follow the ideas presented in Jean-Luc Doumont's book \work{Trees, Maps, and Theorems}.
